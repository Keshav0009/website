	<p>Harry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994) is an English singer, songwriter and actor. 
	Born in Redditch, Worcestershire, his musical career began in 2010, when he auditioned as a
	solo contestant on the British music competition series The X Factor. Following his 
	elimination early on, he was brought back to join the boy band One Direction, which
	eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. 
	After the band's indefinite hiatus in 2016, Styles signed with Columbia Records as a solo 
	artist.</p>
	<p>Styles released his self-titled debut album in 2017, which topped the charts in fourteen 
	countries and ranked in several music critics' year-end lists. The album's single, 
	"Sign of the Times", topped the UK Singles Chart, peaked at number four on the US Billboard 
	Hot 100 and was named "Song of the Year" by Rolling Stone, while its music video earned Style
	s a Brit Award. Styles made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk (2017). 
	His second studio album, Fine Line (2019), debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and broke the 
	record as the biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US in the Nielsen 
	SoundScan era. The album yielded the UK and US top 10 singles "Adore You" and
	"Watermelon Sugar".</p><br/>
